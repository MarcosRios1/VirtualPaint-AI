# VirtualPaint-AI
Using OpenCV created a simple color detection program that allows you to draw on your live webcam feed

colorPicker.py is just a tool to find the optimal hue, saturation, and value parameters for different colors.

Everything can be run from main.py. Using the OpenCV library, the program simply detects the edges of a marker shaped object for orange, green, or pink. Attaches a point to the end of your 
your marker and allows you to draw onto your live webcam feed. Functionality for starting/stopping drawing, undo, and saving changes will be added.
